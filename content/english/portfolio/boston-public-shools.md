According a [research](https://www.northeastern.edu/csshresearch/bostonarearesearchinitiative/projects/school-choice-assignment/) conducted by [Boston Area Research Initiative](https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/academic-ventures/research-initiatives/boston-area-research-initiative) (BARI),
racial and socialeconomic inequality still prevails in Boston's school assignment system.

This research project with BARI aims to address the inequity by giving underserved students more access to high quality schools. I built an optimization algorithm that iteratively adds new schools to the choice baskets of the underserved population, by looking into seat competion and other measures.
