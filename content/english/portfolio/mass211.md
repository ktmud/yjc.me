[Massachusetts 2-1-1](http://mass211.org/) is a phone service similar to 3-1-1 and 9-1-1, but for human services.

With the support from [Massachusetts 2-1-1](http://mass211.org/) and [Boston Area Research Initiative](https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/academic-ventures/research-initiatives/boston-area-research-initiative), I completed a comprehensive analysis on Mass 2-1-1 datasets, including both the call records and human service resources database. I used various data science techniques to uncover the relationship between 2-1-1 demands and community characteristics, built graphics and tools for easier data exploration, and produced multiple data byproducts that may be helpful for future projects on public health and human service issues in Massachusetts.

I tested using generalized linear models to predict 2-1-1 demands with community characteristics and established a solid baseline for prediction performance.
I examined the variable importance with Random Forests and investigated the subtleties in community characteristics that could be help locate vulnerable population.

The data I studied are composited into a [single interactive map](https://mass211.herokuapp.com/), which allows the public and policy makers to compare multiple variables side-by-side at different geographical levels. I also created a resource map where users could type and search instantly for any 2-1-1 resources.
