With the support from [Massachusetts 2-1-1](http://mass211.org/) and [Boston Area Research Initiative](https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/academic-ventures/research-initiatives/boston-area-research-initiative), I conducted a comprehensive analysis on the Mass 2-1-1 datasets, for both the call records and resource database. I utilized various data science techniques to uncover the relationship between 2-1-1 demands and community characteristics, built graphics and tools for easier data exploration, and produced multiple data byproducts that may be helpful for future projects on public health and human service issues in Massachusetts.

I tested multiple generalized linear models for predicting 2-1-1 demands with community characteristics and established a solid baseline for the prediction. I examined the importance of variables and investigated the subtleties in community characteristics that could be helpful in locating vulnerable population.

The data I studied are composited into a [single interactive map](https://mass211.herokuapp.com/), which allows the public and policy makers to compare multiple variables side-by-side at different geographical levels. I also created a resource map where users could type and search instantly for any 2-1-1 resources.
