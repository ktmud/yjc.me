Hi, my name is **Jianchao Yang** (杨建超). I am a Data Technologist and Software Engineer who loves building data-centric products and runimating on data-driven decisions.

I recently finished the [Master's in Data Science](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/program/data-science-ms/) program at Northeastern University, Boston, MA, during which I had internships at [GMO](https://www.gmo.com/) and [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/).

Before steering into the world of Data Science, I worked as a Front End Engineer for 6 years, in companies of many industries and different sizes, including [Alibaba](https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/global/home), [Douban](https://www.douban.com), and [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/).
