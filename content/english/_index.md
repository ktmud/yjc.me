Hi! This is Jianchao Yang. Call me "Jesse" if that's easier.

I am a Data Technologist and Applied Machine Learning Researcher with 7 years of professional experience and 2 years of experience in conducting data analysis with advanced statistical methods
and making data-driven decisions for real world business and social questions.

Before steering into the world of Data Science, I was a Full Stack Software Engineer and have worked for world or regional leaders in ecommerce ([Alibaba](https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/global/home)), social media ([Douban.com](https://www.douban.com)), travel ([Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/)), finance ([GMO](https://www.gmo.com/)), and real estate ([Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/)).

I just recently graduated with a Masterâ€™s in Data Science from Northeastern University, Boston and am seeking full-time opportunities as a Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, or Data Science Software Engineer starting Spring 2019.

Check out my [portfolio](/portfolio/) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ktmud/) for the type of work I have done and my full professional experience.
