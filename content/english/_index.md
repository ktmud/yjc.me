Hi! My name is Jianchao Yang (<ruby>
杨 <rt>Yáng</rt><rp></rp>建超<rp></rp><rt>Jiànchāo</rt><rp>）</rp>
</ruby>). You can call me "Jesse" if Chinese 
pronounciation is not your strong suit.

I am an aspiring Data Scientist with 6+ years of experience in full stack
software development and applied machine learning. I had worked for world industry
learders in e-commerce ([Alibaba](https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/global/home)),
travel ([Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/)), finance ([GMO](https://www.gmo.com/)) and real estate ([Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/)). 

I am passionate about building human-centric data products and applying
state-of-the-art data processing and machine learning methods in answering
real world business and social questions. My past work includes [large-scale data collection and management](https://github.com/ktmud/github-life),
[data mining](https://github.com/ktmud/yelp-and-neighborhoods), [geographic data analysis](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gmiyy0miuwmjtpu/Final_Paper-edited.pdf?dl=0),
and [predictive analysis](https://github.com/ktmud/mass211/blob/master/Mass%20211%20-%20Final%20Report.pdf).

I am currently finishing my Master's in Data Science 
at Northeastern University, Boston and am actively seeking full-time Data Scientist, Machine Learning
Engineer, or Data Engineer opportunities starting Spring 2019.
