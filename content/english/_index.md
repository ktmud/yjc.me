Hi! This is Jianchao Yang. Call me "Jesse" if that's easier.

I am a Data Technologist and Software Engineer with 7 years of professional experience, of which 2 years in data science.

Before steering into the world of Data Science, I was a Full Stack Software Engineer and have worked for world leaders in ecommerce ([Alibaba](https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/global/home)), social media ([Douban.com](https://www.douban.com)), and travel ([Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/)).

I started pursuing a Master's in Data Science at Northeastern University, Boston in 2016 and did two co-ops at [GMO](https://www.gmo.com/) and [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/). I have recently graduated and am looking for full-time opportunities as a Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, or Data Science Software Engineer starting Spring 2019.

Check out my [portfolio](/portfolio/) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ktmud/) for the type of work I have done and my full professional experience.
