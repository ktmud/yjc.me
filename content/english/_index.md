Hi, my name is **Jianchao Yang** (杨建超), a Data Scientist/Software Engineer living in Seattle, WA.
I love building human-centric data products and solving underdefined business and engineering problems.

I was a Frontend Engineer for 7 years but went back to school in 2016 for an education in [Machine Learning and Data Science](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/program/data-science-ms/)
at Khoury College of Computer Sciences, Northeastern University. I now work as a Data Scientist at [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/).

I have lived in 5 different cities on 3 continents since graduating college. My goal of life is to see as much different things, deal with as many different problems as I can.

Check out my [portfolio](/portfolio/) and [resume](/jianchao-yang-resume.pdf) for the type of work I do.
