Hi! My name is Jianchao Yang. Call me "Jesse" if that's easier. I am a Data Technologist and Software Engineer with 7 years of professional experience.

Before steering into the world of Data Science, I used to be a Full Stack Software Engineer and worked for many different industries, including ecommerce ([Alibaba](https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/global/home)), social media ([Douban.com](https://www.douban.com)), CRM ([Curiosity China](https://curiositychina.com/)), and travel ([Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/)).

I started pursuing a Master's in Data Science at Northeastern University, Boston in 2016 and did two co-ops at [GMO](https://www.gmo.com/) and [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/) in 2018. I just recently graduated and am looking for full-time opportunities as a Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, or Data Science Software Engineer starting Spring 2019.
