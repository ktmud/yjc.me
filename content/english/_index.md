Hi! My name is Jianchao Yang (杨建超). You can also call me "Jesse" if Chinese 
pronounciation is not your strong suit.

I am an aspiring Data Scientist with extensive experience in full stack
software development. I had worked for world industry
learders in e-commerce ([Alibaba](https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/global/home)),
travel ([Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/)), finance ([GMO](https://www.gmo.com/)) and real estate ([Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/)). 

I am passionate about building human-centric data products and applying
state-of-the-art data processing and machine learning methods in answering
real world business and social questions. My past work includes [large-scale data collection and management](https://github.com/ktmud/github-life),
[data mining](https://github.com/ktmud/yelp-and-neighborhoods), [geographic data analysis](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gmiyy0miuwmjtpu/Final_Paper-edited.pdf?dl=0),
and [predictive analysis](https://github.com/ktmud/mass211/blob/master/Mass%20211%20-%20Final%20Report.pdf).

I am a huge believer of "learning by doing" and am constantly finding myself new
challenges to take on and new domains to explore. When authoring web pages bores me, I built a [chat robot](https://github.com/node-webot/weixin-robot); when JavaScript bores me, I wrote
[a modular CMS in Python](https://github.com/ktmud/david); and when data wrangling bores me,
I returned to building [a web app](https://mass211.herokuapp.com/) and learnt geovisualization.

I am currently finishing my Master's in Data Science 
at Northeastern University, Boston and am actively seeking full-time Data Scientist, Machine Learning
Engineer, or Data Engineer opportunities starting Spring 2019.
